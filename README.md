# Algorithms-Design-Analysis-Project
This project was a part of my Algorithms Design & Analysis course at Habib University. We were required to pick a problem and perform an empirical runtime analaysis of it's algorithms.
Our project was about finding shortest path problem. The problem can be modelled as a graph and algorithms can be devised to traverse the graphs such that we may find a solution to the Shortest Path Problem.
